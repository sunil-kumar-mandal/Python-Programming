# 🐍 Python-Programming

Welcome to my Python learning journey! 👋  
I'm a postgraduate Zoology student venturing into the world of programming — and this repository is where I’m collecting all the code I write while learning Python from scratch.

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

As a student of **biological sciences**, I want to understand how **coding meets biology**. This includes:

- Automating sequence analysis
- Understanding bioinformatics tools
- Becoming data-fluent in the era of AI & genomics

This repo is my evolving lab notebook 🧪.

## 🛠️ Tools I Use

- **Python** (of course!)
- **VS Code**
- **Git & GitHub**
- Will explore: `Biopython`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` soon.
